            <img src="mumbai international_airport.jpg" alt="bg image"width="800" height="500">
            <p>inspired by the dancing peacock, India’s national bird, the picturesque Terminal 2 of Mumbai’s Chhatrapathi Shivaji International Airport that caters to 40 million passengers and a million tonnes of cargo per annum was recognized as The World’s Best Airport by the Airports Council International in 2017. A brownfield complex that had to be built in the middle of a fully functioning airport features a new passenger terminal of close to 4.5 lakh sq. ft. Our scope also involved reconstruction and widening of 6.5 km of runways; 3 parallel taxiways, 10 million sq. ft of hard stands, taxiways, aprons for wide-bodied aircraft and associated support buildings, systems and utilities. A 6-lane, 3.3 km elevated corridor connects the airport to the Western Express Highway and the 83.8 m tall ATC tower also incorporates the peacock in its architecture.</p>

            <img src="durgam_cheruvu.jpg" alt="bg image"width="800" height="500">
            <p>.The city experienced a boom in traffic due to the increasing number of cars owned, and the Jubilee Hills to Madhapur commute, which historically took 30 minutes, began to take 40–60 minutes. The Government of Telangana then put forward a proposal of a bridge through Durgam Cheruvu to ease traffic in the area and cut down travel time to 10 minutes.The Durgam Cheruvu Cable Bridge is an extradosed bridge in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. The bridge is located near Inorbit Mall at Madhapur. The bridge connects Jubilee Hills with Financial District and eases traffic congestion to Madhapur across Durgam Cheruvu. Each pillar it has 13 cables each side.</p>
